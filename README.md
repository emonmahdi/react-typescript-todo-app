<h3 align="center">TypeScript Handbook for React Developers â€“ How to Build a Type-Safe Todo App</h3>
</div>

## Introduction

In today's JavaScript landscape, TypeScript is gaining more and more popularity,
and React developers are increasingly embracing it. If you're a React developer
looking to explore TypeScript or enhance your skills with it, this tutorial is
just for you. I'll guide you through using TypeScript in a React application by
building a classic todo app.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project in your local development environment, follow
these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git@github.com:emonmahdi/react-typescript-todo-app.git
```

2. Open the cloned folder in your preferred code editor, install the required
   dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. To access the starter files for the tutorial, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout starter
```

4. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You are now ready to go!

## Use the concept of this project:

### What is useRef and how to to use it with TypeScript

useRef is a special hook in React that creates a reference to an element or
value in your component. This reference can be used to access and manipulate the
referenced element directly, without causing re-renders.

You'll commonly use it to access DOM elements, manage focus, or store mutable
values across component renders.

### What is forwardRef in React?

In React, the forwardRef function is a feature that allows you to pass a ref
from a parent component to a child component. Refs are used to access and
manipulate the underlying DOM elements directly.

By using forwardRef, you can create a custom component that can receive a ref
and pass it down to a specific element within the component.

### What is React Context?

React Context API is a feature in React that allows data to be shared and
accessed by components without passing it explicitly through props. It provides
a way to create a global state that can be accessed by any component in the
application.

React Context API simplifies the process of sharing data across components,
eliminating the need for manual prop drilling.

### What are Interfaces in TypeScript?

In TypeScript, interfaces are a way to define the structure and shape of an
object. They allow you to specify the properties and their types that an object
should have. Think of an interface as a blueprint or a contract that describes
what an object should look like.

Imagine you are building a house. Before starting the construction, you would
have a blueprint that outlines the design and layout of the house. Similarly, an
interface in TypeScript is like a blueprint for an object.

Let's look at a simple example of an interface:

````ts
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}```
````
